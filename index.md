I got surfcasted off the internet, but the weather still seems questionable. Healthier, had to reel in my social media use

Things just seem harsher now though, and harder to express. And harder to disstinguish what's just been put there

Harder to know what you stand for, how you identify, how you connect, how you recover

But it's growth, and things to grow for, and getting the passion back.



Also, brain recovery

Driving in winter conditions takes some getting used to.

It was cold enough that I encountered ice in the first ten metres of driving my rental.

The next day I went for a scenic drive. Fine enough at the top of the hill, but underestimated the valley I was heading in to.

There were fords on the road. 

Given the choice between a ford of running water on the left side, and a paved concrete path with visible frost on the right side of the road, what choice do you make?

# Left

Follow the letter of the law, and stick to the left side of the road? 

Congratulations, everyone else who thought the same tracked water up the mound, and you have driven on to solid ice. 

You have no further traction to pull forward.

You step out of the vehicle to assess the situation. 

You slip and fall on your arse. Fair.

You have attracted bystanders from the local camp. 

Having the support of someone empathetic has prevented you from making the situation worse.

You remind yourself of your insurance policy: you absolute cockwomble.

# Right

With guidance, I reversed back a bit, then with a bit of velocity the front wheel drive family SUV makes it out unscathed. 

Lesson learned. 

A cautionary tale about following your preconceptions.

That was a situation where I had a clear choice between two options.

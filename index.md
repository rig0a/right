imagine having positive emotions

---

real talk, I've been feeling the emotional toll of social isolation for a while now

a relationship fucks out, well, that's beans

bit different when it's also your closest mates drifting away, but they're friendships you really wish you had back

and there's having a personality where doing what you're doing, accepting it, and frothing it works out, and then there's having to deal with the sum of your actions when you're actually missing something

an identity fucks out? how do you get it back, when you're in the same whenua you've been since you were born, and you're picking up the pieces, and it's just like, yeah, I'm alive, but there's a part of me I lost

closet, car accident, formative years at uni, car accident where I survived and met a soulmate, returning back in to the closet broke and without a handle on the situation, losing it instead of coming out ahead together

And yeah, I'll acknowledge being a dickhead, I was 23. Things then generally became more surreal, and I've witnessed the world shift around me while I just kinda stuck there, having gone through an exceptionally poor few situations, anchored at home, not out enough to make something from it. Which is fine, I guess, but through that I lost some of my closest friendships, isolated myself further ditching social media, and just generally lost all the surface level friendships as well.

But it's just a long series of events, and you tend to remember where things were left, and when you're not in touch it becomes a negative vibe, which becomes self fufilling

and I'm not really sure how to reconcile the fact that the day I almost lost my life on the road was the same day I came out via means of relationship failure, while also encountering a part of myself that I lost in physical baggage, while knowing things aren't exactly where they left off

it's obviously a trajectory I want to amend, but again, it's an identity problem and it's not solved overnight, knowing how reconnecting with myself means so much hard mahi and effort, and yeah you obviously have to work to be the person you want to be, but there's so much lost, but so much to find

while then dropping a level and realising perception of self isn't what others perceive of you, but I'm clearly aware of what I'm putting out at the moment

shit's tough, you know it, and you surmount it. but a little "where the fuck did all my mates go" turns in to "did he have a mate around" and well yeah your brain starts making shit up to bounce the trauma, which rapidly shatters your perception of the world

so, heal from it, grow from it, reconnect from it, you're just a couple steps away from it
